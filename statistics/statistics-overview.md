# Statistics Overview

> Statistics is the branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of numerical data (Dangeti p. 8)

There are many concepts covered by statistics that have application in data science and machine learning. Notes regarding these concepts are listed below.

## Variable Types and Scales of Measurement

## Descriptive versus Inferential Statistics

Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that involves organizing, displaying, and describing data wheres Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that involves drawing conclusions about a population based on information contained in a sample taken from that population.

Descriptive statistics apply only to the members of a sample or population from which data have been collected. In contrast, inferential statistics refer to the use of sample data to reach some conclusions (i.e., make some inferences) about the characteristics of the larger population that the sample is supposed to represent. (Urdan p. 2)


## Resources
I think I lay on the spectrum when it comes to books and do really appreciate an author that communicates concepts that prove to be intuitive, well...at least for me. Statistics books that I find useful include:
- [Naked Statistics](https://www.booktopia.com.au/naked-statistics-charles-wheelan/book/9780393347777.html) by Charles Wheelan
- [Statistics in Plain English](https://www.amazon.com.au/Statistics-Plain-English-Timothy-Urdan/dp/0805852417) by Timothy C Urdan and 
- [Statistics for Machine Learning](https://www.packtpub.com/product/statistics-for-machine-learning/9781788295758) by Pretax Dangeti
